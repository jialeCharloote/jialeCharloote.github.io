Hi, I am a second-year master's student in the [Master in Computational Social Science Program (Economic Concentration)](https://economics.uchicago.edu/graduate-study/macss-econ) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I hold a B.B.A. in Applied Economics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) and was an exchange student at [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en) during the Fall of 2021.


My academic interests include **corporate behavior**, **information technology**, **financial economics**, and **entrepreneurship**. I am passionate about leveraging technology to process and analyze information, exploring its real economic consequences, and understanding how it shapes stakeholders' beliefs and behaviors. Through my research, I aim to reduce information asymmetry and contribute to improving social welfare.
