I am a second-year master's student in the [Master in Computational Social Science Program (Economic Concentration)](https://economics.uchicago.edu/graduate-study/macss-econ) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My academic interests center around corporate behavior, information technology, financial economics, and entrepreneurship. I am passionate about leveraging technology to process and analyze information, exploring the economic consequences of information and culture, and understanding how information shapes stakeholders' beliefs and behaviors. Additionally, I aim to study the real impact of laws and regulations, with the goal of informing regulators and contributing to a more efficient and fair market.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, playing badminton, and traveling. I have learned to play the pipa, flute, and harmonica. I’m always eager to learn new things, and I believe the true meaning of life lies in experiencing and discovering the world around me through both theory and practice. 

<u>I'm activately looking for <strong>2025 Fall Ph.D. Opportunities</strong>!</u>
