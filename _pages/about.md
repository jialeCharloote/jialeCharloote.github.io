I am a second-year master's student in the [Master in Computational Social Science Program (Economic Concentration)](https://economics.uchicago.edu/graduate-study/macss-econ) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My academic interests include corporate behavior, information technology, financial economics, and entrepreneurship. I am passionate about leveraging technology to process and analyze information, exploring its real economic consequences, and understanding how it shapes stakeholders' beliefs and behaviors. Through my research, I aim to reduce information asymmetry and contribute to improving social welfare.
