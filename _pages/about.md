Hi, I recently earned my Master‚Äôs degree in [Computational Social Science (Economics Concentration)](https://economics.uchicago.edu/masters-programs/macss-economics) from [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I hold a B.B.A. in Applied Economics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), and I was an exchange student at [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en) in Fall 2021.

I currently work as an Associate in the Antitrust & Competition practice at [Charles River Associates (CRA)](https://www.crai.com/), where I apply economic analysis to complex legal and regulatory issues.

My academic interests include **behavioral economics**, **environmental economics**, **financial economics**, **information technology**, and **artificial intelligence**. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to process and analyze information, understand how it shapes stakeholder behavior, and explore its real economic consequences. Through my research, I hope to reduce information asymmetry and contribute to improving social welfare.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies üé¨, listening to music üéµ, traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, and playing sports üè∏. I also play the pipa and the flute.
