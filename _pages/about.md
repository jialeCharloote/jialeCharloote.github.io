I am a second-year master's student in the [Master in Computational Social Science Program](https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs-pre-doctoral-program/) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My academic interests lie in development economics, financial economics, information technology, and corporate responsibility. I am passionate about leveraging different technology to analyze and process information, and I am always eager to learn and explore new ideas.
