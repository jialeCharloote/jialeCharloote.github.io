Hi, I’m Charlotte. I recently completed my Master’s in [Computational Social Science (Economics Concentration)](https://economics.uchicago.edu/masters-programs/macss-economics) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I also hold a B.B.A. in Applied Economics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), and I spent a semester abroad at [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en).  

I currently work as an Associate in the Antitrust & Competition practice at [Charles River Associates (CRA)](https://www.crai.com/), where I use economic analysis and large-scale data to address complex legal and regulatory issues.  

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of **data science, economics, and technology**. I am particularly interested in how information and artificial intelligence shape markets, organizations, and decision-making. Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my technical expertise through further study in **computer science/data science** and to pursue opportunities where I can bridge **economic insight with data-driven innovation**.  

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling ✈️, cycling 🚴, playing badminton 🏸, and exploring music — I play both the pipa and the flute 🎶.
