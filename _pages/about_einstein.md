- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.





- I am a second-year master's student in the [Master in Computational Social Science Program](https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs-pre-doctoral-program/) at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My academic interests lie in development economics, financial economics, information technology, and corporate responsibility. I am passionate about leveraging different technology to analyze and process information, and I am always eager to learn and explore new ideas.
