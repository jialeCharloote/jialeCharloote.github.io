Introduction</h2> <p>EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is an online database maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It collects and provides public access to filings from companies required to submit documents to the SEC. These filings include financial statements, disclosures, and other regulatory reports such as Form 10-K (annual reports), Form 10-Q (quarterly reports), Form 8-K (event-driven reports), and Form 4 (insider trading reports). EDGAR plays a crucial role in enhancing transparency, offering investors, analysts, and researchers critical information to assess corporate performance and regulatory compliance.</p> <p>EDGAR Log Files record internet search traffic for EDGAR filings, capturing detailed user interactions with the EDGAR system. These log files include metadata such as search activities, file access, and document downloads. They typically contain timestamps, file types accessed, and document names.</p> <p>The availability of EDGAR log data was discontinued after 2017 but resumed in May 2020. From what we know, no one has processed the new dataset yet. It differs from the earlier version—most notably, it no longer provides IP addresses. More detailed information about this dataset can be found on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/edgar-log-file-data-sets" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SEC’s official website</a>.</p> <p>In this blog, we aim to provide a short descriptive analysis of the new EDGAR dataset (June 1, 2020, to June 31, 2024) and discuss its potential applications in related research.</p> <hr> <h2 id="ii-prior-literature">II. Prior Literature</h2> <p>The EDGAR log dataset has been widely used to study investor attention, access patterns, and the economic consequences of information disclosure. For example, Drake et al. (2015) examined the downloading patterns of EDGAR filings and their relationship with firms’ earnings announcements from 2008 to 2011.</p> <p>Earlier versions of the EDGAR dataset (pre-2017) contained IP addresses, enabling researchers to distinguish between human users and automated bots, with many studies excluding bot searches (Loughran and McDonald, 2017; Ryans, 2017; Drake et al., 2015). However, Drake et al. (2020) included bots to examine institutional investor behavior, as automated data retrieval often reflects institutional activity.</p> <p>The new dataset from 2020 no longer provides IP addresses. While this shift limits certain analyses, the data remains highly valuable for tracking interactions with specific filings.</p> <hr> <h2 id="iii-data-processing">III. Data Processing</h2> <p>We downloaded and processed the EDGAR log data to obtain download dates and accession IDs. We counted the number of downloads per day per accession ID per CIK (Central Index Key). Using the SEC’s index, we supplemented this with information such as form type, filing date, and company name.</p> <p>Due to the dataset’s size—each daily log file contains millions of download records—we used the <strong>UChicago Midway3 cloud computing platform</strong> to process the files. Our code for processing and analysis is available <a href="https://github.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <hr> <h2 id="iv-key-findings">IV.

Discussion &amp; Further Research</h2> <p>The analysis of EDGAR log data from 2020 to 2024 highlights evolving investor attention trends, with technology companies at the forefront. The sharp rise in requests during 2023 suggests that external factors, such as geopolitical events and market volatility, influence these trends.</p> <p>Several events since 2020, including <strong>COVID-19</strong>, <strong>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</strong>, <strong>the Israel-Gaza conflict</strong>, and the <strong>rise of AI technologies</strong> like ChatGPT, have shaped market behavior. For example, our content analysis shows that requests for filings related to Russia increased ahead of the invasion.</p> <h3 id="potential-research-extensions">Potential Research Extensions：</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Market Reactions</strong>: Analyze how certain filings (e.g., 8-K, Form 4) affect stock prices following high download volumes.</li> <li> <strong>Impact of Global Events</strong>: Correlate download patterns with major events like COVID-19 or advancements in AI.</li> <li> <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: Use NLP to assess how investor sentiment shifts with new disclosures, particularly for tech companies.</li> <li> <strong>Historical vs. Current Filings</strong>: Investigate why investors search for historical filings and how they use past disclosures to inform current decisions.</li> </ul> <p>By continuing to analyze this dataset, researchers can gain valuable insights into how corporate disclosures influence market behavior and investor decision-making.</p> <hr> <h2 id="vi-references">VI.
